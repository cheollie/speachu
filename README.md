# speachu
speachu is a mobile app that analyzes and provides feedback/tips to improve on presentations and speeches using AI technology to help students, people in the workplace, or just anyone affordably improve their public speaking and presenting skills.

Made for [TechNova2021](https://technova2021.devpost.com/) by Chelsea W., [Fatma J](https://github.com/geckobia), Annie W., and Kailey C.

## Usage/Instructions:
Don't run it as a whole.
I'm just using this to show the code not run the code. 
The `my-voice-analysis` folder has all the working configured ai components. 
The `App.js` and `package.json` has all the source code for the semi working app. (For this you will need to download the Expo Go app to scan the QR Code. Note iOS will not record audio so that part won't work, but for android devices everything should work (recording, playing the audio, getting the randomized video for the audience simulator.)
